            <p>Hey there! I'm Margarette Vergara, a student from Polytechnic University of the Philippines, currently taking up Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCpE). I am also a working student who helps out part-time in our family business whenever I’m available. I see this not only as work but also as a way to support and contribute to our family’s efforts.
               In my free time, I love to unwind by watching Korean dramas and movies or listening to music. My favorite K-dramas are “Welcome to Samdal-ri” and "Lovely Runner". I enjoy these shows because they are wholesome, emotional, and heartwarming, but what really makes “Lovely Runner” stand out for me is its time travel/parallel universe theme, which happens to be my favorite genre in fiction.
               When it comes to music, my favorite song is “Talk to Me” by Cavetown. I love this song because it has such a calming and comforting vibe. The lyrics feel relatable, like it’s a quiet reassurance when life gets overwhelming. It’s the kind of song that brings peace and warmth, which is exactly what I need during busy or stressful days.
               Overall, I’m passionate about technology, always ready to lend a hand to my family, and I enjoy the little things that make life meaningful; whether it’s a great drama, a good song, or a quiet moment of relaxation.
